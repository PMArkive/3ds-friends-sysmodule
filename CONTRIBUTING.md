# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

For smaller changes, feel free to make a pull request. For larger changes, please open an issue to discuss the feature and implementations.

When adding or modifying functionality, please add tests that serve as documentation for the changes and ensure regressions won't happen.

Since this project is meant to modify the functionality of the official sysmodule and is written in a different language than the original, there is no need to maintain a 1:1 reimplementation as long as the existing public API is the same, but you may do so if you'd like and it makes sense.
